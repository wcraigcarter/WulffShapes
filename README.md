# WulffShapes

Wulff Shapes:

This is an interactive that computes and displays Wulff Shapes interactively.

One enters the Miller indices and surface energy (energy/area) of each of the facets and
the can be changed on the fly.

It contains all of the 32 crystallographic point groups and the Bravais lattice parameters can
be changed interactively.

This code uses a fast algotrithm to compute the Wulff Shape and thus allows the
user to see changes in the Wulff shape as one changes facet energies nearly instantaneously.

Wulff shapes are shapes that crystals take when the surface has its energy minimum value for
a fixed crystallite volume.  This codes treats the case when all of the surfaces are facets.

One of the notebooks is a Wolfram .cdf which can be run interactively with the Free CDF player: [https://www.wolfram.com/player/.](url)



The other is a Wolfram Mathematica notebook that can be edited with a Mathematica license.

It is also possible, but slow, do use this tool on the Wolfram Cloud: [https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/ccarter/Published/Wulffshapes/Wulff_Shape_Calculations_and_Visualization_2026.cdf.nb](url)

This code is a rewrite (2026) of the previous Wulffmaker.
It is faster and some errors have been fixed.
